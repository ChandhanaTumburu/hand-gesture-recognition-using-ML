Hand Gesture Recognition System
This project implements a real-time hand gesture recognition system using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. The system captures video from a webcam and processes each frame to detect and track hand landmarks. It then applies custom gesture recognition logic to identify specific hand gestures and displays corresponding labels on the video feed.

Features:

Real-time hand gesture detection and tracking.
Custom gesture recognition for specific hand movements.
Live display of gesture labels overlaid on the video feed.
Utilizes MediaPipe for accurate hand landmark detection.
Technologies:

Python: Programming language used for the implementation.
OpenCV: Library for real-time computer vision and video processing.
MediaPipe: Framework for hand landmark detection and tracking.
Usage:

Clone the repository: git clone <repository-url>
Install dependencies: pip install opencv-python mediapipe
Run the script: python hand_gesture_recognition.py
Press 'q' to quit the video feed.
Feel free to contribute or open issues for improvements. Enjoy exploring hand gesture recognition!
